# Interactive Form
A front-end project to utilize JavaScript as well as REGEX's to create a dynamic form.


## Background
Created for Project 3 of the Treehouse Fullstack Tech Degree.

 I actually intend to use this project for some of my personal events that I host such as Murder Mystery parties. I'm very
 excited to learn backend development in order to hook this up!

### Future Improvements

1. Custom errors for different form validations
2. The code could be refactored for easier readability
